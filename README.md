# API Build Template

If you're just starting out on [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and building your skills to follow an opinionated architecture such as [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), this template for building [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) API routes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will help you get started faster. :)

# How to use

- Fork and clone this repository
- Install Node.js in your system
- Run `npm install` to get the dependencies
- Start building your API routes!

# Features

- This boilerplate uses [file system](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) and [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) node modules to read and write to JSON files as an option.
- The 4.16.0 release of Express comes with [express.json](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.json), a built-in middleware based on `body-parser`
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) are optional npm packages for automatically restarting node applications after file changes, and logging HTTP requests respectively.
- [shortid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid) for generating random id's for each entry

# Issues / Suggestions

As with any open-source projects, this is a work-in-progress so improvement suggestions are welcome!

# To-do's

- Update Features section :)
- Create nested routes for multiple resources via `express.Router()`
- Add tests
